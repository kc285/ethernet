Example Ethernet switch project
================================
Directory structure:

1) dut - Has RTL files
2) env - Has TB components

To compile and simulation in Questa/ModelSim:
=============================================

1) Be in this ethernet directory
2) vlib work
3) vlog -sv -f file.f +incdir+env
4) vopt +acc packet_tb_top -o dbg_pkt_tb_tp  (Note: This step is only to not do a design optimization for full visibility)
5) vsim dbg_pkt_top   (Opens GUI) Use   vsim -c dbg_pkt_top to run in Batch Mode

Note: If you are using ModelSim SE (free version) - please give  extra argument +define+NO_RANDOMIZE  to vlog
This is because  free simulator doesnt support  SystemVerilog  randomize() function and hence I have a custom function to randomize in env/eth_packet.svh


To compile and simulation in www.edaplayground.com
=============================================
1) Go to www.edaplayground.com
2) You will see two windows - one on left as Testbench and one on right as design
3) EDA playground has a limitation of 10 files at a max. So do something like following
4) Upload all dut/* files on right side - design window - but  then copy all module definitions to a single file
5) Upload all env/* files on left side - testbench window
   Now since edaplayground needs your top level file as testbench.sv, you will have to copy your contents from env/packet_tb_top.sv to testbench.sv
   
6) On the left side options - you will see a place to enter  compile and run options 
   In the second line enter  " +define+NO_RANDOMIZE "
   
7) All set and now you can hit run.

8) Further keep modifying as per your wish and keep learning .

Hope this helps.
